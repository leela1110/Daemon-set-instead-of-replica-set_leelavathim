Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set:

ReplicaSet ensures that the number of pods of an application is running on the correct scale as specified in the conf file. 
Whereas in the case of DaemonSet it will ensure that one copy of pod defined in our configuration will always be available on every worker node
DaemonSets are useful for deploying ongoing background tasks that you need to run on all or certain nodes, and which do not require user intervention. 
like node monitoring daemons like collected
